## Glad to see you here! 😄

I’m a **Software Engineer** who loves building scalable backend systems and clean, intuitive web applications.

I enjoy working on **system design, microservices, and full-stack applications**, and I’m always curious about how large-scale systems work under the hood.

🗓️ **Joined GitHub** a few years ago and still consistently learning & shipping.

Since then, I’ve been actively:
- pushing code regularly 🚀  
- solving real-world problems  
- contributing to projects & experiments
